NAME
    bibmod - Modify .bib files

SYNOPSIS
        perl bibmod.pl [bib_file ...] [-all] [-prf=prf_file] [-verbose]
                       [-nofm] [-nopause]

DESCRIPTION
        Designated .bib files are modified according to the predefined
        modifier routines and/or user preferences.
        Although any .bib file can be modified, this program can be
        particularly useful for EndNote-exported .bib files,
        where many strings need to be converted to LaTeX commands.

OPTIONS
        bib_file ...
            .bib files to be modified.

        -all (short form: -a)
            All .bib files in the current working directory will be modified.

        -prf=prf_file
            A user preferences file for string modifications.
            String pairs contained in this file take precedence
            over the predefined modifier routines.
            Refer to the sample file 'sample.prf' for the syntax.

        -verbose (short form: -verb)
            Display the new lines of a bib file before its modifications.

        -nofm
            Do not show the front matter at the beginning of the program.

        -nopause
            Do not pause the shell at the end of the program.

EXAMPLES
        perl bibmod.pl molytech.bib -verbose
        perl bibmod.pl molytech.bib murine.bib -prf=molytech.prf
        perl bibmod.pl -all -nofm -nopause

REQUIREMENTS
    Perl 5

CAVEATS
        Please make sure that your .bib files are encoded in UTF-8;
        non-7-bit characters will be corrupted otherwise.
