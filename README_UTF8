When a .bib file to be modified is not encoded in UTF-8,
which can happen when a .bib file is exported from EndNote,
the non-7-bit characters (such as Greek letters) will not be parsed correctly.
Such a non-UTF-8 file can be recognized by broken letters
at the beginning of the file and the perl executable complaining about
the printing (print or say).
